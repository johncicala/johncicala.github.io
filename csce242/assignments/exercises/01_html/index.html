        <h1>Seaside Park, New Jersey</h1>
        
        <p>This web page is about my hometown! My hometown is Seaside Park, New Jersey. Seaside is 
            a beach town located on the east coast in the middle of New Jersey. Seaside provides its residents
            with plenty of beaches and other fun activities to take advantage of.
        </p> <br>
        <p>Many people from different parts of New Jersey choose to spend their summer days in 
            Seaside. Others come from as far as states like New York and Pennsylvania. The winters
        are very refreshing and provide a quiet contrast to the busy summer. This web page will provide
    some brief information on Seaside, such as pictures and fun things to do. </p>
